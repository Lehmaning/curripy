# __temporary

This private package is only used for storing  ``.pyi``(stub files) for better type hint support.

As its name, related contents would be removed after having upstream offered better solutions.

## List of  functions whose type hints got overlaid

- operator.is
- operator.is_not
- functools.lru_cache
- functools._lru_cache_wrapper
